Loops in Java
Java provides several looping constructs that allow you to execute a block of code multiple times. These are:

1. For Loop
The for loop is used when the number of iterations is known beforehand.

Syntax:
java
Copy code
for (initialization; condition; update) {
    // Code to be executed
}

Why Use Loops?
Loops help in:

Reducing code redundancy
Simplifying repetitive tasks
Iterating through arrays, collections, or ranges
